# Project Setup and Requirements

This section outlines everything you need to get started with Photon Quantum, including the system requirements, project creation, SDK download, and how to configure your Unity project for Quantum development. This guide is intended for intermediate Unity developers learning Photon Quantum.

---

## 1. System Requirements

Before setting up a Photon Quantum project, verify that your system meets the following requirements:

- **Unity Editor:** Version **2022.3.54**  
- **Supported Platforms:**
  - PC (Windows/Mac)
  - WebGL
  - Mobile (Android, iOS)

These requirements ensure that you have the optimal environment for developing and testing your multiplayer game with Photon Quantum.

## 2. Photon Account Creation

1. **Create a Photon Account:**  
   - Visit the [Photon Engine website](https://www.photonengine.com/) and create an account if you don’t already have one.
   - A Photon account is required to access the Quantum SDK downloads and to create your Photon Quantum AppId later on.

---

## 3. Downloading the Photon Quantum SDK

1. **Download the Latest SDK:**  
   - Go to the Photon SDK & Release Notes page on the Photon website.
   - Download the latest **Photon Quantum SDK**. The SDK is provided as a `.unitypackage` file.
   
2. **Import the SDK into Unity:**
   - Open Unity and create a new project (for example, an empty 2D project).
   - In Unity, select **Assets > Import Package > Custom Package…** and navigate to the downloaded `.unitypackage`.
   - Import all the files from the SDK into your project.

## 4. Project Setup in Unity

Once you have imported the Photon Quantum SDK, the following steps will guide you through the initial project configuration:

### 4.1 Quantum Hub

- **Quantum Hub Window:**  
  After importing the SDK, the Quantum Hub window opens automatically.  
  - If it doesn’t appear, open it manually from **Quantum > Quantum Hub** in the Unity menu.
  - Click on the **"Install Quantum User Files"** button. This process will generate the default configuration and settings files needed by Quantum.

### 4.2 App ID Configuration

- **Creating and Linking a Photon Quantum AppId:**
  - Log in to your Photon Dashboard.
  - Click the **“Create a New App”** button at the top right.
  - From the drop-down menu, select **Quantum**.
  - Choose the **Quantum 3 SDK version**, fill in the necessary information, and click **“Create.”**
  - Copy the provided AppId from the Photon Dashboard.
  - Return to the Quantum Hub in Unity and paste your AppId into the **App Id** field.
  
  This links your Unity project to the Photon cloud, allowing you to run your game online.

### 4.3 Navigating the Photon Quantum Project Structure

- **Folder Organization:**  
  All Photon Quantum files are imported into the **Photon** and **QuantumUser** folders.  
  - **Do not** change the folder structure or move any Quantum files. Maintaining the folder structure is crucial for Quantum’s functionality.
- For more details on the folder hierarchy and file purposes, refer to the Quantum SDK documentation included with your download.

## 5. Unity Editor Settings for Photon Quantum

### 5.1 Editor Configuration

- **Quantum Editor Settings:**  
  - Navigate to **Tools > Quantum > Find Config > Quantum Editor Settings**.
  - Here you can adjust settings such as enabling Quantum XY mode (useful for 2D projects) and other simulation-related settings.
  
### 5.2 Project Build Settings

- **Add Scenes to Build Settings:**  
  - Make sure the required scenes (e.g., the main gameplay scene, menu scene) are added to your **Build Settings**.  
  - This is essential for both local development and when publishing your game.

## 6. Comparison with Traditional Unity Setup

In a typical Unity project using GameObjects and MonoBehaviours:

- **Input, Logic, and Rendering** are handled in a single loop inside MonoBehaviour scripts (e.g., in the `Update()` method).  
- The entire game state is often synchronized over the network, leading to possible performance issues and non-deterministic behavior.

**Photon Quantum, on the other hand:**

1. **Input Handling:**
   - Inputs are collected through dedicated Quantum input pollers (e.g., **LocalQuantumInputPoller.cs**) that convert Unity input into deterministic fixed-point values.
   - Only the minimal input state is sent over the network.

2. **Deterministic Simulation:**
   - The simulation operates on a fully deterministic ECS model using fixed-point math, ensuring consistent state across all clients.
   - Physics, movement, and game state updates occur in separate systems (e.g., **MovementSystem.cs**, **WeaponSystem.cs**).

3. **Separation of Simulation and View:**
   - Simulation code is completely decoupled from view code.
   - Quantum uses view components (e.g., **CharacterView.cs**, **WeaponView.cs**) to update visual representations without affecting the deterministic simulation.

4. **Rollback and Re-Simulation:**
   - In Photon Quantum, incorrect local predictions due to network latency or packet loss are corrected using rollback mechanisms.
   - In Unity, fixing such discrepancies would require custom solutions that are more error-prone and complex.

5. **Modularity and Efficiency:**
   - Quantum organizes game logic into independent systems and components, which are easier to optimize and maintain.
   - Unity’s MonoBehaviour-based model often results in tightly coupled and harder-to-optimize code.

## 7. Summary

The project setup and requirement phase is crucial for Photon Quantum development. By ensuring your system meets the necessary requirements, downloading and importing the SDK correctly, and configuring both the Photon Hub and Unity Editor settings, you establish a solid foundation for building robust, deterministic multiplayer games.

This section has guided you through these essential steps and contrasted them with traditional Unity development practices. Next, we will move on to further explore the Photon Quantum simulation architecture and advanced features.
