# Quantum Project Structure and Workflow

This section explains how a Photon Quantum project is organized and outlines the typical development workflow. The focus is on the deterministic simulation, asset organization, and code generation process—all of which differ considerably from traditional Unity development using GameObjects and MonoBehaviours.

> **Note:** The examples provided here are drawn from production‐ready code and emphasize key architectural elements of Quantum. They will help you relate these concepts to the real implementation.

---

## 1. Overview

Photon Quantum is built on an advanced Entity Component System (ECS) that separates simulation code from view (rendering) code. This separation enables deterministic simulations that support rollback and re‑simulation—all while maintaining network consistency. The project structure follows a strict folder hierarchy designed to keep simulation assets, view code, and configuration files clearly separated.

---

## 2. Folder Structure and Organization

The Photon Quantum SDK organizes files into two primary folders:

1. **Photon Folder**  
   Contains core files and libraries maintained by Photon.  
   
2. **QuantumUser Folder**  
   Contains user-specific assets, scripts, and configuration files. The organization in this folder is critical to preserving Quantum’s deterministic and modular structure.

   **Key Subfolders:**
   - **Simulation:**  
     * Contains simulation code (systems, components, Qtn files) that use fixed-point arithmetic (FP) for deterministic behavior.  
     * Example files: `MovementSystem.cs`, `PlayerSystem.cs`, `SkillSystem.cs`.

   - **View:**  
     * Contains Unity-side scripts that manage entity views, visual effects, and UI elements.  
     * Example files: `CharacterView.cs`, `WeaponView.cs`, `BulletFxController.cs`.

   - **Resources:**  
     * Contains Quantum Assets (immutable data objects) such as map assets, system configuration files, and runtime configuration assets.  
     * Do not move or modify these files arbitrarily, as their proper location is essential for Quantum’s asset loading routines.

> **Tip:** Always maintain the folder structure provided by the SDK. This ensures that Quantum’s code generation and asset linking features work reliably.

## 3. Main Assets and Configuration Files

Quantum relies on various asset objects to configure the simulation. Key configuration assets include:

- **SimulationConfig.asset:**  
  Contains configurable settings for the simulation (physics, networking, etc.).  
  *Example: In `SimulationConfig.User.cs`, default values for physics and collision detection are defined.*

- **RuntimeConfig.asset:**  
  Provides global runtime configuration. This includes references to assets such as the map, system configs, and game configuration.  
  *This is extended via scripts like `RuntimeConfig.User.cs`.*

- **SystemsConfig.asset:**  
  Lists all the systems that should run in the simulation in a specified order.  
  *Systems such as `MovementSystem.cs`, `WeaponSystem.cs`, and others are registered here.*

- **Map Assets (e.g., AsteroidsMap):**  
  Represents static level data (colliders, meshes, navigation data) which are baked during the scene setup.

- **Quantum DSL Files (.qtn):**  
  These files define entity components and input types using a domain-specific language similar to C#.  
  *Examples include `Bullet.qtn`, `Character.qtn`, and `Skill.qtn`.*

> **Example Code Reference:**  
> In **BulletData.cs**, the `BulletData` abstract class inherits from `AssetObject` and holds simulation-specific parameters such as `Damage` and `Range`. This pattern is consistent across many Quantum asset files.

## 4. Quantum Simulation Components

The simulation code in Quantum is organized into systems that update only when specific components exist on an entity. This selective processing is managed via filters.

### Key Points:
- **Systems and Filters:**  
  Systems such as **MovementSystem.cs** use a filter struct to operate on a set of components. For example:

  ```csharp
  public struct Filter
  {
      public EntityRef Entity;
      public Transform2D* Transform;
      public PlayerLink* PlayerLink;
      public Status* Status;
      // Additional component pointers as needed
  }
  ```
  
- **Deterministic Updates:**  
  All calculations use fixed-point arithmetic (via the `FP` type) to guarantee identical results across all clients. This ensures that re‑simulation and rollback are feasible.

- **Input Handling:**  
  Input is abstracted by Quantum input pollers (e.g., **LocalQuantumInputPoller.cs**) which retrieve and convert Unity’s input into deterministic fixed-point values.

> **Comparison with Unity:**  
> In Unity, game logic is often implemented in MonoBehaviour’s `Update()` method and depends on non‑deterministic floating point values. In Photon Quantum, the simulation operates on a separate timeline using deterministic systems that strictly process components.

## 5. Quantum View Architecture

The view (rendering) in Quantum is separated from the simulation. This is managed through:
- **Entity View Components:**  
  Classes inheriting from `QuantumEntityViewComponent` update visual representations based on the simulation state. For instance, **CharacterView.cs** synchronizes the transform data from the simulation to a Unity GameObject.

- **Event Subscription:**  
  View components subscribe to simulation events (e.g., bullet destruction or character death) to trigger visual effects without affecting simulation integrity.

> **Comparison with Unity:**  
> In Unity, a MonoBehaviour might combine simulation logic and rendering in one script. With Quantum, the simulation logic is isolated in systems (running on the deterministic simulation) while view updates are handled separately, allowing independent optimization of rendering and simulation.

---

## 6. Workflow Overview

The general Photon Quantum workflow is as follows:

1. **Project Setup:**  
   - Import the Quantum SDK.
   - Configure the Quantum Hub by installing user files and linking a Photon AppId.
   - Maintain the proper folder structure, especially within the **QuantumUser** folder.

2. **Asset Creation & Configuration:**  
   - Create necessary configuration assets (e.g., SimulationConfig, RuntimeConfig, SystemsConfig).
   - Define game-specific assets such as map data, character prototypes, and weapon configurations.

3. **Simulation Development:**  
   - Write simulation systems using the ECS model. Systems operate on filtered entities using pointers and fixed-point math.
   - Write Qtn files to define components and input types.
   - Utilize signals and events to manage asynchronous actions (e.g., respawning, bullet collisions).

4. **View Development:**  
   - Create view components to handle rendering, particle effects, and UI synchronization.
   - Use Quantum’s entity view components to reflect changes in simulation state.

5. **Input & Communication:**  
   - Use dedicated input pollers and converters to feed deterministic input into the simulation.
   - Utilize the deterministic simulation to handle rollback and resimulation, ensuring all clients converge to the same state.

6. **Testing and Debugging:**  
   - Employ Quantum’s debug runner (e.g., **QuantumDebugRunner**) for local testing.
   - Monitor performance using built-in profiling tools and adjust simulation parameters accordingly.

7. **Multiplayer Integration:**  
   - Leverage Photon’s networking capabilities to synchronize simulation state across clients.
   - Use player data and signals (e.g., **ISignalOnPlayerAdded**) to manage player-specific events.

> **Communication Cycle Example:**  
> In Photon Quantum, the simulation communicates via signals and events. For instance, when a bullet collides with an object:
>
> - The **BulletSystem.cs** processes collision detection and then calls:
>
>   ```csharp
>   bulletData.BulletAction(frame, filter.Entity, targetEntity);
>   ```
>
> - This triggers a signal (such as `OnCharacterHit`), which can be subscribed to by other systems (e.g., **StatusSystem.cs** for applying damage) and by view components (e.g., **BulletFxController.cs** to play particle effects).
>
> In a traditional Unity approach, a MonoBehaviour might directly call methods on other components or use UnityEvents. In Quantum, the deterministic simulation ensures that these communications are repeatable and consistent across clients.

## 7. Comparison with Unity’s Classic Workflow

### Unity GameObject and MonoBehaviour Paradigm:
- **Integrated Logic and Rendering:**  
  Simulation and view updates often occur within the same MonoBehaviour `Update()` or `FixedUpdate()` methods.
- **Non‐Deterministic:**  
  Reliance on floating-point arithmetic leads to slight discrepancies across different platforms or hardware.
- **Network Synchronization:**  
  Requires custom solutions to maintain consistent game state across clients, with higher bandwidth usage.

### Photon Quantum Workflow:
- **Modular ECS Architecture:**  
  Separates simulation (deterministic, fixed-point calculations) from view (rendering, effects, UI).
- **Determinism and Rollback:**  
  The simulation runs identically on all clients due to fixed-point math, making rollback and re‑simulation robust.
- **Event-Based Communication:**  
  Uses signals and events to decouple simulation logic from view updates, reducing tight coupling and simplifying network synchronization.
- **Reduced Bandwidth:**  
  Only minimal player input is synchronized over the network, and the deterministic simulation is reproduced on each client.
