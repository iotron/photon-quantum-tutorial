# Photon Quantum Overview

Photon Quantum is a high‑performance, deterministic multiplayer game engine built on an advanced Entity Component System (ECS) architecture. Its design ensures that online multiplayer games remain fully synchronized and reproducible across all clients. In this section, we discuss the core principles behind Photon Quantum and demonstrate how its simulation model differs fundamentally from Unity’s traditional GameObject‑based approach.

## 1. Core Concepts

Photon Quantum is built upon three interlinked concepts:

1. **Deterministic Simulation**
   - Quantum uses fixed‑point arithmetic (FP) instead of floating‑point math.  
   - This guarantees that all clients compute the same results given the same inputs, ensuring full determinism.
   - *Example:* In the bullet simulation system, the bullet’s position is updated using FP values:
     ```csharp
     public override void Update(Frame frame, ref Filter filter)
     {
         // Calculate the new position using fixed‑point arithmetic
         filter.Transform->Position += filter.BulletFields->Direction * frame.DeltaTime;
         // Check if the bullet has traveled too far, and handle accordingly
         CheckBulletDistance(frame, ref filter);
     }
     ```
     Here, the use of `FP` types ensures that every client independently simulates bullet movement identically.

2. **Entity Component System (ECS) Architecture**
   - **Entities:**  
     - Represented by a unique identifier (`EntityRef`), entities in Quantum are lightweight and do not contain behavior by themselves.  
     - They are created using methods such as `frame.Create(prototypeAsset)`.
   - **Components:**  
     - These are plain data containers (defined via C# or Qtn files) that hold simulation state such as `Transform2D`, `Status`, or `WeaponInventory`.
     - Components use FP types to maintain deterministic state.
   - **Systems:**  
     - Systems are responsible for processing entities that have specific components.  
     - They typically inherit from classes like `SystemMainThreadFilter<T>` or `SystemSignalsOnly` and use filters to operate only on entities with the required data.
     - *Example:* In the **MovementSystem.cs**, a system iterates over each entity that has components like `Transform2D` and `PlayerLink`:
       ```csharp
       public override void Update(Frame frame, ref Filter filter)
       {
           if (filter.Status->IsDead)
           {
               return;
           }
           QuantumDemoInputPlatformer2D input = *frame.GetPlayerInput(filter.PlayerLink->Player);
           var config = frame.FindAsset(filter.KCC->Config);
           filter.KCC->Input = input;
           config.Move(frame, filter.Entity, filter.Transform, filter.KCC);
       }
       ```
       This code clearly separates data (components) from behavior (system logic) and ensures that all simulation logic runs in a data‑oriented, deterministic way.

3. **Separation of Simulation and View**
   - The simulation layer runs deterministically and independently from Unity’s rendering process.  
   - Visual representations (views) are handled by separate view components (e.g., `QuantumEntityViewComponent`) that subscribe to simulation events (signals) and update Unity GameObjects.
   - *Example:* The **BulletFxController.cs** view component listens for bullet destruction events:
     ```csharp
     public override void OnInitialize()
     {
         QuantumEvent.Subscribe<EventOnBulletDestroyed>(this, OnBulletDestroyed);
     }
     ```
     This design ensures that even if the rendering is non‑deterministic, the core game state remains predictable and consistent across clients.

## 2. Advantages over Unity’s MonoBehaviour Model

Photon Quantum’s architecture offers several benefits compared to Unity’s classic GameObject and MonoBehaviour approach:

1. **Determinism:**
   - Uses fixed‑point arithmetic and a pure data‑driven ECS, eliminating rounding issues typical of floating‑point math.
   - Guarantees all clients simulate the same outcomes for the same input, crucial for competitive multiplayer games.

2. **Rollback and Re‑Simulation:**
   - If a client receives delayed or inaccurate input, Quantum can roll back to a previous frame and re‑simulate with the corrected data.
   - This mechanism is difficult to implement reliably with Unity’s built‑in systems.

3. **Modularity and Performance:**
   - By decoupling game logic (simulation) from the view (rendering), Quantum minimizes overhead and allows each layer to be optimized separately.
   - Systems are lightweight and focus solely on processing data, which avoids the complexity (and non‑determinism) that arises when behavior and rendering are mixed.

4. **Network Efficiency:**
   - Only player inputs are transmitted over the network.  
   - The full game state is recreated deterministically on each client, reducing bandwidth requirements compared to traditional state synchronization in Unity.

## 3. Summary

Photon Quantum represents a paradigm shift from Unity’s classic MonoBehaviour‑based approach to a modular, deterministic simulation framework. Key takeaways include:

1. **Deterministic Simulation:**  
   - Quantum guarantees identical computation across devices via fixed‑point math.
2. **ECS Architecture:**  
   - Entities serve as unique identifiers, components encapsulate data, and systems process these components efficiently.
3. **Decoupled Simulation and View:**  
   - Simulation logic remains independent from visual rendering, facilitating robust rollback and network synchronization.
4. **Efficiency and Scalability:**  
   - With its data‑driven design, Quantum minimizes state synchronization overhead and scales well for large multiplayer experiences.

This overview lays the groundwork for understanding Photon Quantum’s internals. In the next section, we will delve into the differences between Photon Quantum’s deterministic ECS model and Unity’s traditional GameObject‑based approach.
